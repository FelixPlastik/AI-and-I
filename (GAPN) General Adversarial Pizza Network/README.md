### The idea of the workshop was to explore how it feels when an essential and human thing like food and dining is combined with machine learning.
### We (AI & I) invited some friends to my place. Everyone brought their favorite ingredients and AI & I provided the technical setup. <br>For the dinner, we used `RunwayML`, an app that has several pre-trained AI which you can use without being an AI expert.

### `human input`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;> <br>`AI layer 1`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br>`AI layer 2`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;> <br>`.....`<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > <br>`Pizza`

### We chose different modes for each pizza:   
<br><br><br>
### `wish2pizza`   
### 1. we write down our favorite pizza ingredients <br> 2. text input gets interpreted into an image <br> 3. we reconfigure the image into a physical pizza .

### `pizza2text`   
### 1. styling pizzas like objects <br> 2. enforcing AI to generate text based on the picture of th pizza.

### `resume`   
### After the evening, I'd say that humans still prefer human pizza over AI pizza. <br> Nevertheless we had interesting conversations about the future of AI and the fields in which AI might lead to a more efficent automation like in mass industry food production, take aways and delivery. Here a short recipe:
