# AI-and-I
Exploring design strategies &amp; tools in a colaborative ping-pong between Artificial Intelligence and Me as a designer.

AI as a technology is already happening, it is mostly subtle so we don't realize it like the perfect google search and our weekly spotify recommendation. While it influences our world (big words ðŸ˜‰) or at least how we consume, our design techniques still keep untouched. 

- [ ] How does it feel to design for or with an AI? 
- [ ] can it be fun or super annoying?  
- [ ] could including AI in a creative process lead to new perspectives on design?

<br>
The following respository is an ongoing collection of design experiments in collaboration with artificial intelligence. 
The mode always changes which means sometimes the AI is the designer, sometimes it is me. Sometimes it is me against AI and sometimes AI has to approve my design. There are no limits. If you want to join, please feel free to add your experiment in a pull request or [mail me](mailto:ciao@pl80.cc?subject=[GitHub]AI%20and%20I)

Objects detection AI is one of the major uses in machine learning since it is way faster and more accurate then any human eye. In this experiment, I used an object recognition AI which is capable to recognize all kinds of objects to design a series of objects that play with AI's recognizability and invisibility of things and its faults.
