# AI-and-I
Exploring design strategies &amp; tools in a colaborative ping-pong between Artificial Intelligence and Me as a designer.

*Artificial Intelligence (AI)* or *machine learning* is a pretty hyped theme but a technology that is already in use and will be used more and more in the future. It is mostly subtle so we don't realize it like â€“ perfect google searches or weekly spotify recommendations. While AI influences our world (big words ðŸ˜‰) or at least how we consume, our techniques to design remain untouched and creativity is called a safe haven for jobs which can not be replaced by AI. 

- [ ] But how does it feel to design for or with an AI? 
- [ ] can it be fun or super annoying?  
- [ ] could including AI in a creative process lead to new perspectives on design?


The following respository is an ongoing collection of design experiments in collaboration with artificial intelligence  
(I have to mention i don't see AI as intelligent but as a tool).  
The mode always changes which means sometimes the AI is the designer, sometimes it is me. Sometimes it is me against AI and sometimes AI has to approve my design..There are no limits!

Objects detection AI is one of the major uses in machine learning since it is way faster and more accurate then any human eye. In this experiment, I used an object recognition AI which is capable to recognize all kinds of objects to design a series of objects that play with AI's recognizability and invisibility of things and its faults.
