### When we look at design, we find that it is often based on face shapes. On the other hand we tend to recognize faces in everything.   
### In this experiment I wanted to take up these characteristics on the one hand and on the other hand use the technology that questions our perception of identity.

2. using a pre-trained AI
  First Order Motion Model is an AI trained on 100.000 faces of celebrities. It
