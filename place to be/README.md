### Stealing identities is a major issue in the use of artificial intelligence. There are AI which imitate voices or writing styles. So-called "deepfakes" can capture faces and map them on other bodies to say and do things that didn't happen. 
### I took this technique and turned it into a playful panorama of our studio. It combines identity-capturing deepfake with the human tendency to see faces in everything and lets the viewer be part of the view.
