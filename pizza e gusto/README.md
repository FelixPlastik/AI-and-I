## `P`i`z`z`a` e &nbsp;`G`u`s`t`o`

### Idea of the workshop was to explore how does it feel, when an essential and human thing like food and dining is combined with machine learning?!
### We (AI & I) invited some friends to my place, everybody brought its favorite ingredients and we provided the technical setup. Therefore we used `RunwayML`, an app that has several pre-trained AI you can use instantly and without being an AI expert.

### workflow:
### `human input` <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br> `AI layer 1`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br> `AI layer 2`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br> `.....` <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br> `output`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;><br> `Pizza`
