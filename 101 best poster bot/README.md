## `101`best`poster`bot

![a](img/poster-archive-1.gif)

To train to be a poster-design-bot you need a dataset. The contest [100 best posters](https://100-beste-plakate.de/) provides an archive with all of their winner posters â€“ hot design and a clean dataset with images of same size! Perfect!
To download the whole archive, I used an image crawler (see `crawler.py` in the directory).


I collaborated with `styleGAN`, an AI that learns on its own without any labeled data and tries to recognise patterns in the posters. Afterwards it can use these learned patterns to design new posters for us!

## `image generation + selection + print`
The AI does not provide 1 poster but a range of extremes of what it learned. So I had to choose the poster within this and decided to screenprint it. Afterwards, I handed in the poster for the contest.

## `resume`   
Sadly our poster did not make it in the 100 best. It seemed that it lacked some parameters for judging it properly. The problems of our collaboration are:   1. too random design <br>2. dataset is too small <br>3. posters are designed in layers like color, form, typography, humor, inspiration, personal style <br>4. poster had no informational layer. (announcement to an event)
In the following, I propose a draft of how different artificial intelligences could be used together, to really replace the creative process of designing a poster:
