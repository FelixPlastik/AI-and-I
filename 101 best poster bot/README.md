### Training an AI to be a poster-design-bot needed a dataset. The contest [100 best posters](https://100-beste-plakate.de/) provide an archive with all of their winner posters â€“ just hot design and a clean dataset with images of same size! perfect!
### To download the whole archive, I used an image crawler (see `crawler.py` in the directory)


### The AI i collaborated with is called `styleGAN`. It learns on its own ("unsupervised") without any classified data and tries to recognise patterns in the posters. Afterwards it can use these learned patterns to design new posters.

### `walkthrough the AI` <br> (after 5000 generations)

### `image generation + selection` <br>`+ print`
### The AI does not give 1 poster but a range of extrems of what it learned so I had to choose the poster, I also decided to screenprint it. Afterwards, I handed in the poster for the contest.

### `conclusion`
### Sadly my poster did not make it in the 100 best. It seemed that it lacked some parameters for judging it properly. The problems of the bot are:   
### 1. too random design <br>2. dataset is too small <br>3. posters are designed in layers like color, form, typography, humor, inspiration, personal style <br>4. poster had no informational layer (announcement to an event)
### In the following, I propose a draft of how different artificial intelligences could be used together, to really replace the creative process of designing a poster:
