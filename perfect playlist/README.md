# All streaming platforms (youtube, spotify, soundcloud, netflix,..) work with recommendations <br> to provide you with the hottest tracks that perfectly match with your taste. The system of "perfect taste" works through inputs like <br> `your search history`,`your listened history`,`your gender`,`your age`,`your location`,`trending videos`,`new content`. 

# All this is constantly fed to an AI algorythm providing you with the perfect sounds. <br> `perfect playlist` is the first pure AI playlist for the office. By cutting out any "personalized" disturbances, a fresh youtube account and without any history, the AI is left alone and reveals a glimpse of how a "clean" AI recommends when there is no personalization.

*Note: A completely bias-free youtube account is impossible. Youtube accounts have to be connected to a Google account, which includes giving at least your age. You can specify your gender with "unspecified" but the algorythm is always optimized to a location. You can select a different language + location in youtube which changes the recommendations indeed. You can also use a VPN service to disguise your IP adress, but then it is connected to the location of the VPN server. So it will always be connected to a location if it is your own or a fake one.*
