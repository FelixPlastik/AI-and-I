# `Wo`r`d` &nbsp; c`ha`i`r`

### In `word chair` I used a technique called [Activation Atlas](https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/). The problem with neuronal networks is that mostly they are black boxes to us, so we don't know whats going on inside. <br> For instance, if we take the image of a dog and put it in the network, it says: `100% dog`. We would agree with that, but we don't know what actually happened inside the black box that it says "this is a dog".   
### `Activation Atlas` reverse engineer the black box to better understand what neuronal networks "think" in certain parts of an image. So they ask: <br> What do you see in the first 10 x 10px?...in the second 10 x 10px?...and so on.

### That creates a grid of assumptions. The assumptions are visualization + text predictions and look like this:

### So I took the "Activation Atlas" to make assumptions about a video of a chair. <br>I used these predictions of the parts of the image for each videoframe (1 image = 71 rows รก 15 = 1065 cells * 247 frames = 263055 predictions) and turned them into a word map.   
   
   
### here are some more tests i made with different objects:
