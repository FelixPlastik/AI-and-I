## `Sounds`like `work`

The highly professionalized design studio is like a boutique and always need the right representation. Mostly its 3-4 people sitting around a table with their Macs in a clean studio while the Bialetti machine is glowing.
AI naturally don't make any noise in its work. In order to create the perfect sound atmosphere for studio "AI and I", we collected all the clean studio pics of the Sagmeisters and Spiekermanns of the world. AI then took these pictures and interpreted them into what it thought the images sound like. I then mixed this sound collection into a 24 hours work ambient.
