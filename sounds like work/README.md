### All streaming platforms (youtube, spotify, soundcloud, netflix,..) work with recommendations to provide us with the hottest tracks that perfectly match with our taste. With inputs like our `search history`,`listened history`,`gender`,`age`,`location`,`trending videos` and `new content` we as users constantly feed the AI algorythm which then predicts what we might want to listen to. <br><br> `perfect playlist` is the first pure AI playlist for the office. <br> By cutting out any "personalized" disturbances with a fresh youtube account and without any history, the AI is left alone and reveals a glimpse of how a "clean" AI makes recommendations when there is no personalization.

*Note: A completely bias-free youtube account is impossible. Youtube accounts have to be connected to a Google account, which includes giving at least your age. You can specify your gender with "unspecified" but the algorythm is always optimized to a location. You can select a different language + location in youtube which changes the recommendations indeed. You can also use a VPN service to disguise your IP adress, but then it is connected to the location of the VPN server. So it will always be connected to a location if it is your own or a fake one.*
